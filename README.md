# Heart Attack Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart attacks using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing various medical attributes, the model can help in early diagnosis and preventive measures for individuals at risk of heart attacks.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and data normalization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data to understand the distribution and relationships between different attributes.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant features that contribute to the prediction of heart attacks.
- **Model Training**: Implementing and training various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing the models for better accuracy and performance.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: The dataset used for this project includes medical attributes such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other relevant features.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and scale numerical features.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical analyses are performed to gain insights into the data.
4. **Feature Selection**: Relevant features are selected based on their correlation with the target variable (heart attack occurrence).
5. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Various machine learning models are trained and evaluated to identify the best performing model.
6. **Prediction**: The final model is used to predict the likelihood of heart attacks based on new input data.
